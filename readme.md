- USA (This disassembly is based off this version)

It uses V1.3.0 of my SNES ROM framework (https://github.com/Yoshifanatic1/SNES-ROM-Framework), the files of which are included in the download for convenience.

If you want to make use of this, you'll need a headerless clean copy of a supported ROM version in order to extract its assets using the provided batch script in the AsarScripts folder. For reference, here are the MD5 hashes of each version to help verify that you have the correct ROM(s):

- USA = "bb6a1198e291c8ae58e9581a4296ed4d"

For more information on the framework, its functions, and other guidelines, consult "Framework Readme.txt" included with the download and/or in the SNES ROM framework repository.
